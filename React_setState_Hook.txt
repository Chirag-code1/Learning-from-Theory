So, today i learnt about React setState Hook, what is it's use and how can we use it.

setState is a Hook provided by react which let's you update or change the state of things you have kept in your 'state'.
Let's understand it with an example in which we will create a botton and will display a number above it. With every click on that button, 
the value of that number will increase by 1.

Firstly, we will create basic structure of react component. (shortcut in vs.code:   rafce = react arrow function component export).
Secondly, create heading in which we will display the number and a button also.


import React, {useState} from 'react'

const App = () => {

  const [count, setCount ] = useState(0);  // setState returns an aray as ===  [current value/function, updated value/function]
  const state= useState(); 
  let count=0;

  const IncNumber =() => {
    setCount(count+1);
    window.log("Count Updated by 1")
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{count}</h1> 
      <button onClick={IncNumber}>Click me!</button>
    </>
  )
}

export default App
